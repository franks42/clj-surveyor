# GPT Feedback for clj-surveyor

**Review Date**: October 29, 2025  
**Reviewer**: GitHub Copilot (acting as GPT)

## 1. High-Level Impressions

- The project articulates a compelling vision: treating a live Clojure system as a graph of entities with history rather than a pile of files. The "Clojure development paradox" and the acceptance of perpetual temporal drift provide a solid philosophical anchor.
- The emphasis on FQN-based relationships (instead of `require` statements) is well reasoned and aligns with how the runtime actually resolves symbols. This gives clj-surveyor a strong differentiation from purely static tools.
- Building the entire experience around queryable relationships is especially powerful. Using Datascript for immutable, time-travelable snapshots fits the problem space.
- The design successfully positions clj-surveyor as a successor to clj-ns-browser and clj-info: not replacing them, but generalizing their runtime-first insights into a richer, persistent data model.

## 2. Observations & Suggestions

- **Event Streams Everywhere**: You already capture `Change Event` entities. Consider broadening the event taxonomy (e.g., `:require-invoked`, `:load-file`, `:test-run`, `:profiling-sample`). That turns the entity-graph into an event-sourced model, enabling causality analysis such as "what happened right before this regression?"
- **Confidence as a First-Class Attribute**: The staleness/confidence model is persuasive. Expose confidence on every API response and encourage downstream consumers (CLI, UI, editor plugins) to surface it prominently.
- **Schema Views**: Besides the core schema, define curated query "views"â€”for example, a *Component View* that groups namespaces/vars by deployment units, or a *Boundary View* that highlights cross-team dependencies. Think of them as saved Datalog queries with domain semantics.
- **Interop Awareness**: Clojure code often depends on Java classes and even dynamic proxies. Document how Java interop entities (methods, constructors) will be represented. That unlocks analyses like "which vars depend on `java.sql`" or "which protocols extend Java interfaces."
- **Runtime Sampling Hooks**: Encourage integrations with `tools.trace`, `tap>`, or custom instrumentation to feed `Usage` entities with frequency data (calls per second, argument shapes). Light sampling combined with entity tracking could surface hot paths even without full profiling.

## 3. Additional Use Cases

1. **Temporal Regression Hunting**
   - *Query*: Given a failing test, traverse backward through change events touching its dependencies to pinpoint the most likely culprit.
   - *Value*: Provides a "time machine" for debugging REPL-driven sessions where code changed multiple times without commits.

2. **Boundary Contract Monitoring**
   - *Query*: List public vars consumed by external namespaces and compare their change velocity vs. advertised stability.
   - *Value*: Helps library authors maintain stable public APIs and highlights risky churn for consumers.

3. **Runtime Footprint Auditing**
   - *Query*: After a long REPL session, identify namespaces or vars loaded only transiently (e.g., via `load-file`) that now linger in memory.
   - *Value*: Detects memory bloat or stale test scaffolding that could be safely cleaned up.

4. **Testing Coverage Correlation**
   - *Query*: Map vars to the tests that exercised them during the last test run (using instrumentation hooks) and compare against change events.
   - *Value*: Highlights untested hotspots or recently changed code with no test coverage.

## 4. Related Tools & Inspirations

- **Smalltalk / Glamorous Toolkit**: Their live object browsers and moldable UIs validate the multi-pane, runtime-driven approach. Studying how Glamorous Toolkit builds custom views per object could inspire pluggable clj-surveyor dashboards.
- **Nix's Flake Registry**: Though from a different domain, Nix tracks dependency graphs with reproducible snapshots. Its model of "inputs" and "outputs" might inspire how to represent build artifacts or environment states as entities.
- **Erlang's Observer**: Offers a runtime inspection tool that visualizes process relationships and message passing. A similar visual metaphor could work for Clojure namespace/var relationships.
- **OpenTelemetry**: Treat each instrumentation event as signals feeding into clj-surveyor's graph. Even if full tracing is overkill, the conceptual alignment is useful for design decisions.

## 5. Implementation Strategy (Complementary Ideas)

1. **Foundational CLI**
   - Deliver a CLI that builds the entity graph for a project and answers a handful of high-value questions (`deps`, `impact`, `staleness-report`). Export results as EDN/JSON so other tooling can consume them.
   - Leverage tools.namespace and clj-kondo analysis data to bootstrap the graph before runtime introspection fills in the gaps.

2. **Embedded Agent**
   - Ship a lightweight agent (library) that applications can depend on. It collects runtime events, writes them into a datascript DB (or streams them), and exposes a control socket for queries. Think "nREPL, but for entity graphs."

3. **Reactive Datalog Layer**
   - Expose query subscriptions: when the underlying entity DB changes, push updates to subscribers. Perfect for a UI but equally useful for alerting (e.g., notify when a dependency violates a rule).

4. **Testing the Temporal Model**
   - Build synthetic workloads that spam redefinitions, hot-reloads, and patchy REPL sessions. Verify the staleness/confidence outputs reflect reality and that incremental updates stay performant.

5. **Integration Path for clj-ns-browser**
   - Offer a compatibility bridge so clj-ns-browser can serve as an initial front-end: feed it the curated entity data to prove backward compatibility and accelerate adoption.

## 6. Risks & Mitigations

- **Data Volume**: Long-running sessions may accumulate large amounts of event data. Consider purging policies, compression, or tiered storage (recent data in-memory, older snapshots on disk).
- **Security**: When capturing runtime data, make sure secrets or PII are handled carefully. Provide opt-in filters or redaction rules.
- **Adoption Curve**: Developers may be wary of "another server" running alongside their REPL. Emphasize that the initial CLI/agent is lightweight, optional, and immediately useful.
