# Conversation Summary (operations-focused)

Date: 2025-10-29

## What this is
A concise, structured summary of our session with emphasis on recent actions performed on this repository and their results.

## Objectives covered
- Drafted and refined design materials for clj-surveyor
- Prepared the repo for external AI review (runtime-first, FQN dependencies, temporal/staleness model)
- Collected and organized external feedback, with heritage validation via clj-ns-browser and Smalltalk lineage

## Recent actions and results
- Created a new review document: gpt-feedback.md (capturing a second feedback pass)
- Updated an earlier review document with an addendum on Smalltalk/clj-ns-browser lineage: gemini-feedback.md
- Read design and context materials to inform feedback:
  - context.md
  - design-document.md (full)
  - design-document-v2.md (concise, entity/temporal-focused)
- Read heritage repo materials in tmp/clj-ns-browser-master for UI lineage and runtime/FQN validation:
  - README.md, project.clj, src/clj_ns_browser/browser.clj
- Enumerated repository structure to confirm expected files and state
- Pushed a review tag to the remote for external reviewers: v0.2.0-ai-review
- Captured a working todo sequence for feedback collation and next implementation steps

## Current state of key artifacts
- design-document.md — full specification and architectural plan
- design-document-v2.md — concise entity/temporal emphasis and query patterns
- context.md — reviewer orientation and success criteria
- gemini-feedback.md — first feedback document plus Smalltalk/clj-ns-browser lineage addendum
- gpt-feedback.md — second feedback document capturing parallel feedback and suggestions

## Decisions validated
- Runtime-first approach (collect from live system when possible)
- FQN-based dependency modeling (treat fully qualified names as real dependencies; requires as conveniences)
- Temporal awareness (staleness/confidence; change events; sync lag strategies)
- UI lineage alignment with Smalltalk-style multi-pane, as embodied by clj-ns-browser

## Pending work (high-level)
- Synthesize cross-AI feedback into a prioritized refinements list
- Prototype Datascript schema for core entities (Var, Namespace, Usage, Dependency, Change Event, Staleness)
- Build minimal runtime collectors for vars/namespaces/usages; wire staleness/confidence updates
- Author a few staleness-aware queries (usage/impact/coupling) to validate the end-to-end flow

## Notes
- No build/lint/tests are applicable yet; this phase is documentation and planning. When code lands, we’ll introduce build/test gates and run them automatically.
